### Hi There, I'm Jennifer Dryden! üëã

‚ö° I'm currently a Systems Design Engineer at the University of Waterloo, with a passion for product, design and code! üé®

I am working at [Google](https://about.google.com) as a UX Engineering Intern this summer on the AR/VR team! 

I previously worked as a Software Developer at [Ceridian](https://www.ceridian.com) on their Dayforce Benefits team making Work Life Better! I also worked at [RBC](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html) as a Software Developer for my Winter 2021 co-op.
