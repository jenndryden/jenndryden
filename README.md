### Hi There, I'm Jenn Dryden! 👋

⚡ I'm a Systems Design Engineering grad from the University of Waterloo, with a passion for product, code & design! 🎨 I'm currently an Associate Product Manager at [@Google](https://github.com/google) working on the YouTube GenAI Shorts team.

I love exploring new projects, frameworks and languages. Feel free to browse around at my previous work and designs, or message me to chat about [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev/)! 😜

I also help run the 2025 Canadian Tech Intern and New Grad Opportunities [repo](https://github.com/jenndryden/Canadian-Tech-Internships-and-New-Grad-2025). If you are interested in helping out or have ideas, please message me to collaborate! 💻
